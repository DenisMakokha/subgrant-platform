# SSOT System Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) system as specified in the requirements.

## 1. Role & Dashboard Registry

### Database Schema
- Implemented `roles` table with fields for id, label, inherits, caps, scopes, visibility_rules, version, and active status
- Implemented `dashboards` table with fields for role_id, version, menus_json, pages_json, and active status
- Added these tables to the Phase A migration script

### APIs
- Created admin controller with endpoints for:
  - `GET /admin/roles` - List all roles
  - `POST /admin/roles` - Create or update a role
  - `GET /admin/dashboards` - List all dashboards
  - `POST /admin/dashboards` - Create or update a dashboard

## 2. Approval Registry

### Database Schema
- Implemented `approval_policies` table with fields for id, name, description, provider, config_json, and active status
- Implemented `approvals` table with fields for id, entity_type, entity_id, doc_uri, title, meta_json, policy_id, provider_ref, status, requested_by, decided_by, decided_at, and comment
- Added these tables to the Phase A migration script

### APIs
- Created approval controller with endpoints for:
  - `POST /approvals/request` - Request an approval
  - `POST /approvals/:id/approve` - Approve an approval
  - `POST /approvals/:id/reject` - Reject an approval
  - `GET /approvals/queue` - Get approval queue

## 3. Validation Schemas (Zod/TS)

### Backend
- Created Zod schemas for role definitions, dashboard definitions, approval policies, and approvals
- Implemented validation in the admin controller for role and dashboard creation/update

### Frontend
- Created TypeScript interfaces for UserExperience, DashboardConfig, and other runtime data structures
- Implemented type-safe API calls in the runtime service

## 4. Capability Catalog

### Registry
- Created `CAPABILITIES` registry with predefined capabilities for different user roles
- Each capability includes key, description, scope, and associated data keys

### Runtime Integration
- Updated runtime controller to return user capabilities based on their roles
- Implemented capability-based access control in the RBAC middleware

## 5. Data-Key Registry

### Registry
- Created `DATA_KEYS` registry with predefined data keys for different entities
- Each data key includes key, description, and required parameters

### Runtime Integration
- Updated data controller to validate data keys against the registry
- Implemented generic `/ssot/data/:key` endpoint with parameter validation

## 6. Registry Management APIs (Admin-only)

### Implementation
- Created admin routes and controller for managing roles and dashboards
- Implemented RBAC middleware to restrict access to admin-only endpoints
- Added validation and error handling for all admin endpoints

## 7. Runtime APIs

### Implementation
- Created runtime controller with endpoints for:
  - `GET /app/experience` - Get user experience data
  - `GET /app/dashboard-config` - Get dashboard configuration for a role

## 8. Generic /data/:key Endpoint

### Implementation
- Created data controller with endpoint:
  - `GET /ssot/data/:key` - Get data by key with parameters
- Implemented data service routing based on data key
- Added parameter validation against the data-key registry

## 9. Generic /action Endpoint

### Implementation
- Created action controller with endpoint:
  - `POST /ssot/action` - Execute an action by key with payload
- Implemented action service routing based on action key
- Added payload validation against the action registry

## 10. Approval Policies and Providers

### Implementation
- Created approval policy repository for database operations
- Implemented InternalApprovalProvider and ApprovalMaxProvider stubs
- Added provider factory for dynamic provider selection
- Integrated approval policies with the approval request flow

## 11. Hot-Reload and Caching

### Implementation
- Created registry cache with TTL support
- Implemented cache invalidation patterns for different entity types
- Added caching to the data controller for improved performance
- Integrated cache invalidation with admin controller for registry updates

## 12. Feature Flags

### Implementation
- Created feature flag registry with predefined flags
- Updated runtime controller to return feature flags in user experience data
- Added feature flag support to the admin controller

## 13. RLS and Security

### Implementation
- Created security middleware with RLS support
- Updated auth middleware to include security context and scopes
- Enhanced RBAC middleware to apply RLS during permission checks
- Added security checks to all controllers

## 14. Admin Wizard Frontend Skeleton

### Implementation
- Created Wizard.tsx component with two-step workflow for role and dashboard definition
- Created Dashboard.tsx component as the main admin dashboard
- Implemented form handling and API integration for role/dashboard creation

## 15. Frontend Runtime

### Implementation
- Created runtime service with functions for:
  - `getExperience()` - Fetch user experience data
  - `getDashboardConfig()` - Fetch dashboard configuration
  - `getDataByKey()` - Fetch data by key with parameters
  - `executeAction()` - Execute an action
- Updated imports to use existing fetchWithAuth function

## 16. Seed Data for Roles

### Implementation
- Created seedRoles.js script with initial role definitions for:
  - admin
  - partner
  - accountant
  - budget_holder
  - finance_manager
- Created initial dashboard definitions for each role
- Implemented seeding logic with conflict resolution

## 17. CI Checks

### Implementation
- Created ci-checks.js script with validation functions for:
  - Capabilities registry
  - Data keys registry
  - Feature flags registry
  - Database connectivity
  - Required tables
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and reporting

## 18. Domain Glue for Approvals

### Implementation
- Created approvalGlueService.js with functions for:
  - Applying approvals to domain entities (fund requests, partner budgets, contracts)
  - Rejecting domain entities
  - Handling approval decisions with transaction support
- Implemented entity-specific approval logic

## 19. Observability

### Implementation
- Created observabilityService.js with:
  - Winston-based logging
  - Metrics collection
  - Health status monitoring
  - API call logging
  - Error tracking
- Integrated with server.js for startup/shutdown logging
- Added logging to key operations throughout the system

## Conclusion

All 19 major components of the SSOT system have been successfully implemented according to the specifications. The system provides a comprehensive framework for role-based access control, data management, approval workflows, and runtime customization with proper observability and security measures.
