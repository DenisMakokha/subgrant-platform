# SSOT Budget and Contract Implementation

This document describes the complete implementation of the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) system for budgets and contracts in the Sub-Grant Management Platform.

## Overview

The SSOT implementation provides a comprehensive system for managing budgets and contracts with full audit trails, workflow management, and integration capabilities. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable.

## Budget SSOT System

### Components

1. **Database Schema**
   - Budget templates with configurable rules
   - Budgets with project and partner associations
   - Budget line categories
   - Budget lines with cost calculations
   - Review threads and comments for collaboration
   - Workflow transition tracking

2. **Repositories**
   - BudgetRepository: Manages budget entities
   - BudgetTemplateRepository: Manages budget templates
   - BudgetLineRepository: Manages budget lines
   - ReviewThreadRepository: Manages review threads and comments
   - PartnerBudgetRepository: Manages partner budgets
   - PartnerBudgetTemplateRepository: Manages partner budget templates
   - PartnerBudgetLineRepository: Manages partner budget lines

3. **Services**
   - BudgetDraftService: Handles budget creation and editing
   - BudgetValidationService: Validates budgets against templates and rules
   - BudgetWorkflowService: Manages budget state transitions
   - ReviewThreadService: Manages review discussions
   - BudgetContractService: Links budgets to contracts
   - BudgetDisbursementService: Manages budget disbursements
   - PartnerBudgetService: Manages partner budgets

4. **Controllers**
   - BudgetSSOTController: Handles API requests for budgets
   - PartnerBudgetController: Handles API requests for partner budgets

5. **Routes**
   - `/api/budget-ssot/*`: API endpoints for budget management
   - `/api/partner-budgets/*`: API endpoints for partner budget management

## Contract SSOT System

### Components

1. **Database Schema**
   - Contract templates with document merge fields
   - Contracts with state management
   - Contract amendments
   - Workflow transition tracking
   - Contract milestones and deliverables
   - Payment tracking
   - Reporting requirements and submissions

2. **Repositories**
   - ContractRepository: Manages contract entities
   - ContractTemplateRepository: Manages contract templates
   - ContractAmendmentRepository: Manages contract amendments

3. **Services**
   - ContractLifecycleService: Manages contract state transitions
   - ContractDocumentService: Handles document generation and management
   - ContractReportingService: Manages reporting requirements
   - ContractPaymentService: Manages payment tracking

4. **Controllers**
   - ContractSSOTController: Handles API requests for contracts

5. **Routes**
   - `/api/contract-ssot/*`: API endpoints for contract management

## Implementation Details

### Database Migrations

The implementation includes multi-phase migrations:

1. **Budget SSOT Migrations**
   - Phase A: Core budget schema creation
   - Phase B: Extended budget features

2. **Contract SSOT Migrations**
   - Phase A: Core contract schema creation
   - Phase B: Extended contract features

### Seeding Scripts

Seeding scripts are provided to populate the database with initial data:
- Budget templates and line categories
- Contract templates

### API Endpoints

The system provides RESTful API endpoints for:
- Creating and managing budgets
- Reviewing and approving budgets
- Generating and managing contracts
- Tracking contract milestones and payments
- Managing reporting requirements

## Integration with Existing Systems

The SSOT system integrates with:
- Notification system for workflow events
- Document management for contract documents
- User management for access control
- Project and partner management
- Email system for communications

## Migration and Deployment

To deploy the SSOT system:

1. Run the database migrations in order:
   ```bash
   node api/scripts/run-budget-ssot-migrations.js
   node api/scripts/run-contract-ssot-migrations.js
   ```

2. Or run all migrations together:
   ```bash
   node api/scripts/run-all-ssot-migrations.js
   ```

3. Seed initial data:
   ```bash
   node api/scripts/seed-budget-ssot.js
   node api/scripts/seed-contract-ssot.js
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   cd api && npm run dev
   ```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive testing for all components:
- Unit tests for repositories and services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for workflow scenarios

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements include:
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Integration with external financial systems
- Enhanced collaboration features
- Mobile-friendly interfaces

## Conclusion

The SSOT Budget and Contract system provides a robust foundation for managing sub-grant budgets and contracts with full traceability and workflow management. The modular design allows for easy extension and customization to meet specific organizational needs.
