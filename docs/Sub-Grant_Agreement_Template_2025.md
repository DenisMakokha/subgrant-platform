11) **Anti-Corruption**

Luigi Giussani Institute of Higher Education (LGIHE) shall maintain and
comply with a written code of conduct that prohibits giving anything of
value, directly or indirectly, to any person or entity, including
government officials, in the form of a bribe or kickback; establishes
appropriate limitations on transactions with relatives or related
businesses or ventures; and otherwise properly governs the performance
of its employees engaged in soliciting, awarding or administering
contracts, and receiving gifts.  Luigi Giussani Institute of Higher
Education (LGIHE) shall promptly inform Zizi Afrique Foundation in
writing of any violations relating to its obligations hereunder and
shall perform and cooperate with any investigation Zizi Afrique
Foundation, in its discretion, may require.

12) **Assumption of Liability/Indemnification**

Each Party assumes all liability for all loss, damage, cost and expense
arising out of or in any way connected with the operation or performance
of, or the failure to perform, any duty, obligation, or activity on that
Party's part, its subcontractor(s), agent(s), or employee(s) in
connection with this Agreement. Each Party recognizes that activities
associated with the Agreement may expose its personnel, vendors, and/or
agents to both direct and indirect safety and security risks.  Each
Party is solely responsible to ensure that adequate measures are taken
to provide for the safety and security of anyone working on its behalf
and/or direction. Neither Party will provide any assistance or support
to the other in the area of safety and security without the prior
express written agreement. A Party ("Indemnitor") shall fully indemnify,
hold harmless, and defend the other Party, its subsidiaries, and
affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
and agents ("Indemnitee") from and against any and all third-party
claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) that arise from or are in any way related to the
negligence, recklessness, intentional wrongdoing, fraud, infringement or
misappropriation of intellectual property, and/or breach of any
obligation under this Agreement by Indemnitor and/or its
subcontractor(s), agent(s), or employee(s).

13) **Non-Waiver**

Failure by either Party to insist upon strict compliance with any of the
terms of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such terms, nor
shall any specific waiver or relinquishment be deemed a blanket waiver
or relinquishment of such right or power. No waiver shall be binding
unless in writing and signed by the Party granting the waiver.

14) **Dispute Resolution**

If the parties fail to resolve the dispute between themselves as per
clause 13 of this contract, all disputes arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement ("Dispute") shall be finally settled under the Rules
of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC
Rules") by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC
Rules. Other than the Request for Arbitration filing fee under ICC
Rules, which shall be solely borne by the claimant, fees required by the
ICC Rules will be borne equally by the Parties. Judgment on the award
may be issued in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Prior to commencing arbitration or litigation, the Parties will first
attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through confidential
negotiation for a period of forty-five (30) calendar days. Such
negotiation shall be between the Parties' senior management, each of
whom must have authority to settle the Dispute.

Notwithstanding the forgoing, either Party may commence proceedings
prior to or during such negotiation if doing so is necessary in order to
avoid the running of a statute of limitations, to seek urgent interim
relief from a court or arbitrator as permitted pursuant to the ICC
Rules, or otherwise to protect a legal right that may be lost as a
result of the passage of time.

15) **Entire Agreement**

This Agreement states the complete agreement of the Parties and
supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements, whether oral or
written, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. If any
provision of this Agreement is found invalid, illegal or unenforceable,
then the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement will not in any respect be affected or
impaired thereby. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute
one and the same instrument. The Parties are entitled to rely on a
counterpart executed and delivered by email/post to the same extent as a
counterpart with an original signature.

16) **Sub grants and Subcontracts; Assignment**

Partner shall not sub grant/subcontract any portion of its performance
without the prior written consent of Zizi Afrique Foundation, except as
set forth in the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Partner may
enter into contracts with third parties as required to conduct its
normal operations and on customary business terms without the consent of
Zizi Afrique Foundation. Partner shall not transfer or assign its
interest in this Agreement in whole or in part without the prior written
consent of Zizi Afrique Foundation. All terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon the respective Parties hereto, their
personal representatives, successors, and assigns.

As Luigi Giussani Institute of Higher Education (LGIHE), we shall always
abide by the requirement set on this page by the donor, WPF and Echidna
Giving during the life of this agreement.
