## 8. Workflow Engine

The [Workflow Engine](workflow-engine.md) documentation describes the state management system, workflow definitions, event system, rule engine, and monitoring capabilities.

## 9. Reporting and Analytics

The [Reporting and Analytics](reporting-analytics.md) documentation covers dashboard design, report types, data modeling, visualization guidelines, export capabilities, and advanced analytics.

## 10. Security and Compliance

The [Security and Compliance](security-compliance.md) document details the security architecture, identity management, data protection, network security, application security, audit logging, business continuity, and regulatory compliance.

## 11. Implementation Roadmap

The [Implementation Roadmap](implementation-roadmap.md) provides a structured 18-month approach to developing the platform across six phases, including resource planning, risk management, and success metrics.

## 12. Updated Implementation Roadmap

The [Updated Implementation Roadmap](updated-implementation-roadmap.md) aligns with the Zizi Afrique â€“ ALiVE Partners Subgrants Management System requirements, providing a detailed 26-week implementation plan organized in 10 phases.

## 13. Dashboard Wireframes

The [Dashboard Wireframes](dashboard-wireframes.md) document provides conceptual wireframes for the Admin, Partner, and Donor dashboards, including layout structures and component details.

## 14. User Stories

The [User Stories](user-stories.md) document captures all user stories organized by persona and phase, ensuring all user needs and requirements are addressed throughout the implementation process.

## 15. Local Development Setup

The [Local Development Setup](local-development-setup.md) guide provides instructions for setting up the Sub-Grant Management Platform for local development, including Docker configurations and development workflows.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sub-Grant Management Platform:

1. Review the [Technical Specification](technical-specification.md) to understand the overall requirements
2. Examine the [System Architecture](system-architecture.md) to understand the component structure
3. Study the [Data Model](data-model.md) to understand the entity relationships
4. Review the [Implementation Roadmap](implementation-roadmap.md) to understand the delivery approach
5. Follow the [Local Development Setup](local-development-setup.md) guide to run the system locally
