# Reconciliation Check Summary

## Executive Summary

The reconciliation check has been completed successfully. All traditional budget and contract implementations have been removed and replaced with a comprehensive SSOT (Single Source of Truth) architecture.

## Traditional Implementations Removed

### 1. Legacy Budget Tables
- `partner_budgets` (replaced by SSOT budget tables)
- `partner_budget_lines` (replaced by SSOT budget line tables)
- `recon_line_evidence` (replaced by SSOT reconciliation tracking)

### 2. Traditional Contract Management
- Legacy contract tracking systems
- Manual contract approval workflows
- Disconnected budget-contract relationships

### 3. Manual Reconciliation Processes
- Spreadsheet-based budget tracking
- Manual evidence collection
- Disconnected reporting systems

## SSOT Implementation Status
